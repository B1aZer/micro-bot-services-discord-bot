## BOT ideas

- any good NFT project has You might like projects on the side

## hardcoded

- channel id in bot-discord/tasks/data/lv2.json

## Coding LOLS

#### redirect error

`>>` or `>` will redirect standard output but error will still be visivle in console. Convenient.

#### env

you should put env to the project that importing files
process that running file will only look in current folder not in imported

#### Semilocns
```
    client.roles = rolesManager.roles.cache
    ['ethereum_handler', 'opensea_handler'].forEach(handler => {
        require(`../handlers/${handler}`)(client);
    });
```
Calls first statemns with array as arg wo semicolon
```
  return log.split('\n')
            // shuffle
            .sort((a, b) => 0.5 - Math.random())
            .slice(0, this.count)
            .sort((a, b) => new Date(b.split(this.separator)[2].trim()) - new Date(a.split(this.separator)[2].trim()))
```
will only return first statement wo semicolon
